                <li><a href="#"><h3 id="FR">Friends</h3></a></li>
                <p>
                    Friends are truly a wonderful thing aren't they? The love between friends is called philia. It is sincere and platonic. I'm on good terms with a lot of people. But those who are the closest to my heart are without a doubt my greatest friends. And I'm truly appreciative of the genuine comrades I have gained in my life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Of course one of the closest "friends" you'll have is your romantic lover. It was truly unexpected how things turned out between us. To think that I would get a girlfriend right when I have stopped trying to find one. Life is strange. But I don't regret it.
                </p>

		<nav id="RC" class="column">
            <ul>
				<li><a href="#"><h3 id="FM">Family</h3></a></li>
                <p>
                    Family is one of those things that will have been with you from the very beginning. It's kind of interesting when you think about how you will know your parents for the rest of your life, but they have known you for only part of theirs. The same goes with your older siblings. Families, when good and healthy, are one of the greatest blessings anyone can receive.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Relating this to my dear partner, we both understand how difficult and embarrassing it is to get to know the other's family. Although she has met my parents. I have yet to meet hers. But I'm not in any rush. We were both told to focus on our grades. Which I completely understand and agree with. So my advice, to other people, is to simply set your priorities straight. You can do it.
